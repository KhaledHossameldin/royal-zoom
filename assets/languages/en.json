  "policies_1": "The policy of inactive account, what is meant by the policy of inactive account on the Royake platform? We always encourage people to continuously log in and use Royake when they register their own accounts. To keep your account active, make sure to log in at least every 30 days. Accounts may be permanently removed due to inactivity for a long period. How does Royake determine the inactive status? Inactivity is based on login activity. It should be noted that you may not be able to know whether the account is currently inactive or not, as not all account activity indicators are publicly displayed. What action should be taken if one of the accounts that is likely to be inactive uses my registered trademark as a username or account name? If you believe there is a trademark infringement and the account appears inactive, please refer to Royake's trademark policy for more information. What action should be taken if I have a username request from an account that appears inactive but I do not have a registered trademark? We cannot issue inactive usernames at this time. So if you want a username already in use by an apparently inactive account, you must choose a different available form to use on the Royake platform. In general, adding numbers, underscores, or abbreviations can help you get an available username. Active use: Your account must be public at the time of application and you must have logged into the account in the past six months.",
  "policies_2": "Temporary Loss of Access to Platform Features or Products: We reserve the right to restrict access to platform features or products, including (but not limited to) tweets, tweet editing, direct messages, spaces, communities, or live streaming. Permanent Suspension for Severe Violations: In cases of severe violations, accounts will be permanently suspended upon the first discovered instance. Examples of severe violations include: managing accounts with predominantly policy-violating behavior; using any of the methods outlined on this page to interfere with election integrity; buying/selling accounts; creating accounts to replace or mimic suspended accounts; managing accounts that can be reliably attributed by Royake to entities known to violate platform rules. If you believe your account has been mistakenly closed or suspended, you can file an appeal. Additional Resources: Learn more about our developer automation policies, election integrity efforts, financial deception policy, hacked materials policy, promotional advertising guidelines, and contests. Find out more about our range of enforcement options and our approach to policy development and enforcement.",
  "policies_3": "What happens if you violate this policy? The consequences of violating this policy depend on the severity of the violation as well as the individual's previous violation history. Also, the action we take is based on the type of disruptive activity we discover. The actions we may take include: challenging troublesome accounts when we detect suspicious levels of activity, accounts may be closed, and additional information (such as a phone number) may be requested or a reCAPTCHA challenge may be solved. Placing URLs in the rejection list involves adding URLs that we deem unsafe to the rejection list or issuing warnings about them. Learn more about unsafe links, including how to appeal if we mistakenly consider your URL unsafe. Restricting tweet visibility may involve not displaying tweets that we deem to violate these policies in specific parts of the Royake product, and/or may not recommend them on the platform and may not work to widely distribute them. Learn more about other instances where individual tweet visibility may be limited. Deleting tweets and temporarily suspending accounts: If platform manipulation or harassment violation is a single or first violation, we may take various actions ranging from requiring the deletion of one or more tweets to temporary account suspension(s). Any repetition of platform manipulation violations may lead to permanent account suspension. In cases of violations related to the use of multiple accounts, you may be asked to choose one account to keep. The remaining accounts are permanently suspended.",
  "policies_4": "Who can report violations of this policy? Anyone can report accounts or tweets through the dedicated reporting pathway. These reports are used collectively to refine policy enforcement systems and identify trending issues and new behavioral patterns. How can I report violations of this policy? Within the application, you can report this content from within the app as follows: Select Report Tweet from the icon. Identify this suspicious or annoying tweet. Select the option that best explains how the tweet is suspicious or causing annoyance. Submit your report. On the website, you can report this content via the web as follows: Select Report Tweet from the icon. Identify this suspicious or annoying tweet. Select the option that best explains how the tweet is suspicious or causing annoyance. Submit your report.",
  "policies_5": "What are not considered violations of this policy? The following are not considered violations of this policy: Posting links without commentary from time to time. Coordinating with others to express ideas, viewpoints, support, or opposition to a certain issue, provided that this behavior does not violate Royake platform laws. Managing multiple accounts with different identities, purposes, or use cases. These accounts may interact with each other as long as they do not violate other laws. Here are some examples: Institutions that have a connection between their branches but are separate entities, such as a company with multiple locations. Managing a personal account in addition to accounts with pseudonyms or accounts dedicated to your hobbies or initiatives. Automated accounts for hobbies/artistic aspects.",
  "policies_6": "Open source code exploiting the open source code of the Ru'yak platform, including the logic behind vision filtering or training a machine learning (ML) model, to circumvent the enforcement of the policy related to platform law violations.",
  "policies_7": "URLs that distribute harmful content or contain links leading to harmful content with the intention of causing harm to another user's browser (malware) or their computer system, disabling it, or exposing their privacy to risk (phishing); posting misleading or deceptive links; such as affiliate links and clickbait links.",
  "policies_8": "Hashtags: Using trending or popular hashtags with the intention of disrupting a conversation or manipulating it to increase visit rates or draw attention to specific accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives; and tweeting using too many unrelated hashtags in a single tweet or across multiple tweets.",
  "policies_9": "Engaging intensely or automatically with tweets to increase visit rates or draw attention to specific accounts, websites, products, services, or initiatives. Adding users to lists or moments extensively.",
  "policies_10": "Follow churn - following then unfollowing a large number of accounts in an effort to increase one's own follower count; Random following - following and/or unfollowing a large number of unrelated accounts in a short period, especially using automated means; Copying followers from another account, especially using automated means.",
  "policies_11": "Editing tweets to artificially amplify content or deceive people. Here are some examples, but not limited to: Using existing posts from tweets to amplify completely different content (e.g., editing a tweet from What's better? Pancakes or waffles? to Thousands trust my service. Like my post and subscribe to my channel for investment tips.)
